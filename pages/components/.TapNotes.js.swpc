               TapNote will help you record all treatment proposals and discussions in a fraction of the time with pre-configured questions based on the patient profile. Aura knows if your patient smokes then dry socket is a more probably scenario. Aura knows if it's a molar then its higher still. In fact, if it was a complex extraction in a patient with a history of dry socket Aura can keep a 15 minute gap in the diary to help management. Aura will learn your preferences and act accordingly over time.
